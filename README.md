# God Player CK3 Mod

This repository contains a simple Crusader Kings 3 mod that adds a `player_god_trait` to let the player rule as a god.
The trait grants extremely high skills, immortality, and new powers such as massive prowess,
increased fertility, and rapid prestige and piety gain. It also unlocks a *Heal Character*
interaction that can be used on any living character.

To install, copy the `mod` folder contents into your CK3 mods directory and enable the mod in the launcher.
